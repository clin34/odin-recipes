   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Vietnamese pho is all about the broth! In this authentic recipe, beef bones, fish sauce, star anise, and ginger simmer for at least 6 hours, creating a complex, aromatic broth that may not be quick, but it's certainly delicious. The flavorful broth is ladled over rice noodles and thinly sliced beef and topped with fresh garnishes.   </p>
